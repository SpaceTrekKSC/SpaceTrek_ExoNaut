 * Commands:
 * exonaut robot;                           //This command sets up the exonaut robot object.  exonaut is the class and robot is the name of the object.
 *                                          //This is the object that handles all of the motor commands and the features on the CoreX controller.
 * 
 * robot.begin();                           //This command initializes or begins the things in the robot object.
 *                                          //It is used once at the beginning of the program
